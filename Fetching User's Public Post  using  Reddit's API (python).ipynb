I use it for both business and personal expenses and make payments on it weekly to ensure my balance stays low.  \\n\\nI pay any personal items with my existing Wells Fargo checking account and any business items with my Comerica bank account and have been doing this for years- anything coming from the Comerica account clears within a couple days.  \\n\\nI got a notification that my credit score went down and I logged into my Wells Fargo account and noticed my credit limit and available credit didn’t reflect my payments.  \\n\\nI checked that the payments have been posted on the Wells Fargo card, I logged into my Comerica account and see all the payments have also cleared.  \\n\\nWhen I called, they were just as confused as I was and said I have holds on all the payments that have already posted and cleared my accounts.   It is very weird since I’ve made payments this way for years.   \\n\\nThey told me they would look into it.  \\n\\nI’m felling a bit nervous because I have things that automatically charge to the account, and I don’t want anything to become rejected.  \\n\\nWhat is the best way to expedite this to reflect my available credit, and can anyone let me know how this happened and how to prevent it from happening again? They escalated the call through 3 tiers and everyone was super confused. \\n\\nHere is a quick sceeen shot of the payments made showing they have “posted” and the difference between my credit line and available credit.  I can also show screen shots of the payments made all month clearing my other bank- so the money is gone just not applied.  \\n\\nScreen shots of payments -edit - deleted screen shots to be ultra safe.',\n",

I use it for both business and personal expenses and make payments on it weekly to ensure my balance stays low.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pay any personal items with my existing Wells Fargo checking account and any business items with my Comerica bank account and have been doing this for years- anything coming from the Comerica account clears within a couple days.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I got a notification that my credit score went down and I logged into my Wells Fargo account and noticed my credit limit and available credit didn’t reflect my payments.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I checked that the payments have been posted on the Wells Fargo card, I logged into my Comerica account and see all the payments have also cleared.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I called, they were just as confused as I was and said I have holds on all the payments that have already posted and cleared my accounts.   It is very weird since I’ve made payments this way for years.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They told me they would look into it.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m felling a bit nervous because I have things that automatically charge to the account, and I don’t want anything to become rejected.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What is the best way to expedite this to reflect my available credit, and can anyone let me know how this happened and how to prevent it from happening again? They escalated the call through 3 tiers and everyone was super confused. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick sceeen shot of the payments made showing they have “posted” and the difference between my credit line and available credit.  I can also show screen shots of the payments made all month clearing my other bank- so the money is gone just not applied.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Screen shots of payments -edit - deleted screen shots to be ultra safe.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': 'Honestly this is more of a complaint about Amrock, their title company, but since the two are inextricably linked, I went with the more recognizable name. I also have a tendency to over-explain, so I’ll be doing my best to curtail that and stick to facts. Please feel free to ask for any clarification you may need. Please note, however, that I am not seeking advice at this time. I’m just sharing my experience. \\n\\nSeptember of 2021 I began a refinance of my mortgage. I was enticed by Rocket’s (almost) all-online process, so when they gave me a reasonable rate I went for it. One of the first things I received was a questionnaire from Amrock asking me about my marital status (divorced), my ex’s marital status (remarried), and my ex’s new wife’s name. This being my first ever time to go through any of this, I had no idea why my ex’s new wife was relevant, and no one ever explained it. Honestly I pretty much forgot they even asked once the process moved forward. \\n\\nFast forward about 7 weeks and it’s time to schedule closing. I provided them with my ex’s contact information so they could arrange for a notary so she could sign a quit claim deed. One reason for this refi was that when we first got divorced, I wasn’t able to get my ex off the mortgage because it appraised underwater. So now it was all going to be taken care of at once. When scheduling the closing for my ex, who now lives in another state, no one ever bothered to confirm whether her new wife would be available. In fact no one even mentioned her relevance to the process at all. \\n\\nClosing came and went with both of us signing our respective copies. I truly thought this was the end and was now just waiting for the 72 hour cancellation window to pass so funds could be disbursed. Around 4 pm on the afternoon before everything was supposed to be paid, I got a phone call from Amrock telling me that payments would be delayed because of missing signatures. My initial reaction was that they simply must not have received my ex’s form yet. But then the person went on to say that they were missing signatures from my ex AND her wife. \\n\\nI was absolutely dumbfounded. The person on the phone had no real knowledge of anything - they were simply relaying a message. Someone was supposed to call me back, but in the meantime I sent a panicked text to a friend who used to be a real estate agent. He explained how standard practice is “one spouse to buy, two to sell” and that basically my ex’s wife also had to be ok with the quit claim deed even though the house was mine per our divorce. \\n\\nAfter a full 36 hours of me not knowing wtf to do, Amrock called to schedule another closing. We both had to sign again which meant that my ex had to take another day off work. This time around, the new wife was simply left off the paperwork. (Which I hope never comes back to bite me.) Funds were disbursed the next evening and I again thought that everything was settled. \\n\\nA month or so later I got a letter from the county. Amrock made a typo on the legal description of my property on the quit claim deed, referring to it as block 1 instead of block 2, so it was invalid. I contacted them so they could fix it. A few weeks after that, they sent me my copy of the original incorrect paperwork. To date, no one has ever apologized to me for any of this, nor have I ever received my copy of the corrected paperwork. However, I honestly just wanted to put it behind me, and didn’t see the need to have my own copy when I could see on the county’s website that everything was updated. \\n\\nFast forward to last night. I was expecting a friend, so the knock on my door at 8:30 was not surprising. It was not my friend; it was a process server. At first I was confused, but then I put it together. The house described by the incorrect block on the quit claim deed is now in foreclosure, and I have been named as a defendant by virtue of my name appearing in that property record. \\n\\nTo say I’m pissed is an understatement. I am ENRAGED. Even though I know that I’ll be able to explain the situation and get myself dismissed off the suit, the necessity of it on top of everything else just infuriates me. The way our state’s court records work, I believe it’s impossible to unlink my name from the case. I’m not concerned about it showing up as a judgment. It’s just that now whenever anyone searches my name, this suit is going to come up.\\n\\nAnyway, this is just to warn you of my experience. I can’t overstate the amount of stress they have caused me over what should have been an extremely simple and routine refi.',\n",

       "     'selftext': \"My father passed away in 2019 leaving my mother (77) with a sizable amount (to us) in savings, life insurance and other assets that is much more than she'll ever spend or use. My mother never handled any of the finances but knew of all of the investments (and rather enjoyed talking with the financial advisors). One of my brothers, a teacher, took over the bill paying and general finances for mom. \\n\\nThis brother also was a father to a severely disabled child that required around the clock care. He had received a large multimillion dollar settlement 20 years ago for the accident that caused the disability. I had assumed that money would last forever. His daughter passed away in 2020. \\n\\nMy other brother, a police officer, suspected a friend of my mother's of taking some money from my mother (for kinda stupid reasons that aren't important) and had access to some bank accounts. He found some weird charges in the banking record. The officer brother called my teacher brother to tell him of his findings and the need to change the bank accounts and have the bank investigate some of the weird charges. At this point, my teacher brother admitted he took the money and was going to pay it back with his tax refund.\\n\\nThen my cop brother found much more money missing from a money market fund and looked like the teacher was paying his own credit card bills and insurance with the money market money. The total missing is over $50,000 and started in 2020. \\n\\nWe've taken the first steps of changing the bank accounts and access from the teacher brother. My mother is super pissed that he stole from her. Luckily, this amount won't affect her life in any way but it is, obviously, a huge breach of trust. The teacher brother has withdrawn from everyone and doesn't respond to texts or phone calls (I'm halfway across the country from everyone else). \\n\\nI'm assuming the money is gone and will never be repaid. But, I'm more worried about what kind of mess my brother is in financially that this was an option at all for him. He does have obvious grief from losing a child and isn't in the greatest headspace even without being caught stealing. I presume my mother would have given him the money if he had asked. I'm working on a theory that my father was giving him money through the years without telling anyone (my father was a teacher as well).\\n\\nWhat steps should I be taking that I'm not thinking of to get us all through this mess? My mother has already taken some of his inheritance privileges away (he was going to get the house and some jewelry because he was going to foreseeably be the one in town when my parents passed away). There's some life insurance he and his children will receive and no one wants to take that away. and, we're obviously not going to bring about any criminal charges.\",\n",

The officer brother called my teacher brother to tell him of his findings and the need to change the bank accounts and have the bank investigate some of the weird charges. At this point, my teacher brother admitted he took the money and was going to pay it back with his tax refund.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then my cop brother found much more money missing from a money market fund and looked like the teacher was paying his own credit card bills and insurance with the money market money. The total missing is over $50,000 and started in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve taken the first steps of changing the bank accounts and access from the teacher brother. My mother is super pissed that he stole from her. Luckily, this amount won&amp;#39;t affect her life in any way but it is, obviously, a huge breach of trust. The teacher brother has withdrawn from everyone and doesn&amp;#39;t respond to texts or phone calls (I&amp;#39;m halfway across the country from everyone else). &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m assuming the money is gone and will never be repaid. But, I&amp;#39;m more worried about what kind of mess my brother is in financially that this was an option at all for him. He does have obvious grief from losing a child and isn&amp;#39;t in the greatest headspace even without being caught stealing. I presume my mother would have given him the money if he had asked. I&amp;#39;m working on a theory that my father was giving him money through the years without telling anyone (my father was a teacher as well).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What steps should I be taking that I&amp;#39;m not thinking of to get us all through this mess? My mother has already taken some of his inheritance privileges away (he was going to get the house and some jewelry because he was going to foreseeably be the one in town when my parents passed away). There&amp;#39;s some life insurance he and his children will receive and no one wants to take that away. and, we&amp;#39;re obviously not going to bring about any criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': 'Hi, all! Sorry if this is long or in the wrong subreddit.\\n\\nOn Sunday, we came home to an eviction notice after being gone for the weekend. Our landlord is turning our apartment into an Airbnb and we have to be out of our apartment by June 25th. We are completely devastated because we love where we live! 5 acres of land, lots of woods with a stream for our dog to swim, great neighbors, in the countryside, quiet. We started our apartment search immediately, but aren\\'t having much luck.\\n\\nWe pay $700/mo. right now for rent with everything included (except internet). I\\'ll be honest, neither of us are great with our money. I have almost no money to my name at the moment and my boyfriend doesn\\'t have much more than I do. We have been living paycheck to paycheck for a while, as much as I hate to admit. I believe this is the kick in the butt we needed to get in gear and start being more responsible, but reality checks are never fun.\\n\\nHis parents told us we can absolutely move in with them and I really am grateful for that! I just don\\'t feel comfortable moving into someone else\\'s home and living with them. I love them both, they are wonderful people; but I just feel like we wouldn\\'t be happy staying there for a few weeks/months. We would have to put all our stuff in storage and nothing would be ours (the upstairs that we would be staying in is very small, it really is just a place to sleep).  I\\'m wondering if this really is the best decision financially.\\n\\nIn order to get an apartment by the end of our lease, we would have to put all bills aside (car payments, insurance) for the month of June in order to save up for a down payment. There are not many places around that are below $1000/mo. that accept dogs (I\\'m not giving him up ever, he\\'s going where we go). Also: on top of needing the \\\\~$2000 down payment, my boyfriends car crapped the bed recently and needs at least $300 in repairs, which also has to be done by the 25th so we can get it off the landlords property.\\n\\nI know it\\'s smart to move in with them because we can save more money and get a place we actually want, and not one that we are forcing ourselves to go to just for the sake of having somewhere to call home, which could easily turn into getting stuck in a lease at a place we could ultimately hate. We have to go through it to get through it, no matter how uncomfortable it makes us. I\\'m just so stressed and sad. I don\\'t have a clear head.\\n\\n**Edit:**  He put an eviction notice on the door. I asked him why because I knew we were all paid up in rent and we never were destructive. The response I got was this:\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s not you guys. It\\'s strictly a financial decision. This place is not making enough money to support itself. We are going to try an Airbnb. I\\'m sorry it has to be you, but we have to start somewhere. We can talk if you like, but it\\'s a done deal. A potential $4000 a month vs. your $700. We have to try.\"  \\n\\nOur lease ended in August 2020 (I have the original lease agreement) and then after that we just went month to month without signing anything. On the eviction notice, he put that our lease ends on July 1st 2022. He basically reinstated the lease over the weekend (without our knowledge) just so he could put the notice on the door. I\\'m not sure if it counts as an eviction notice - even though that\\'s what the document said - or if it\\'s more of a lease end and not giving us the option to sign again. ',\n",

On the eviction notice, he put that our lease ends on July 1st 2022. He basically reinstated the lease over the weekend (without our knowledge) just so he could put the notice on the door. I&amp;#39;m not sure if it counts as an eviction notice - even though that&amp;#39;s what the document said - or if it&amp;#39;s more of a lease end and not giving us the option to sign again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': \"I have been writing a book for the last couple years regarding my journey to a million dollars (net worth).  The first part is primarily the story, and the second part is a detail of lessons I've learned along the way.  I've struggled with one particular chapter more than any others and thought I'd post it here to get some feedback.  \\n\\nWriting this book is mostly therapeutic and the likelihood of it ever being published is slim.  So, I'm not trying to sell or pitch the book.  I'm a terrible editor, so look past the spelling and grammatical errors. I just want your personal opinions regarding this chapter.  \\n\\nWithout further ado:\\n\\n**Finances and Friends Can Be Like Oil and Water**\\n\\nTalking about personal finance with your peers, especially your friends can be a delicate and fragile venture. It seems that friends should be able to talk about anything, right? I’ve had to learn the hard way that this isn’t always the case. Talking about finances can be extremely toxic if both parties do not share the same logic as each other. \\n\\nIf two people, chasing the same financial dreams, with the same factors in place, decide to discuss personal finance, it usually goes off without a hitch. After all, you’re both like-minded, and have the same ultimate goal of attaining financial peace. It’s easier to bounce ideas off of each other, and learn from each other’s inevitable mistakes during the process. You can become each other’s cheerleader and often keep each other in line when the urges, that pressure all of us, come pushing down on you. Much like two buddies that hit the gym together with the ultimate goal of achieving a healthier lifestyle.\\n\\nBut if two people with completely different factors attempt to discuss personal finance, I’ve noticed it often results in some awkward moments. And in a few cases, has completely terminated friendships. This isn’t always the case, but can be the case depending on the mindset of the people involved. \\n\\nAs someone who feels they’ve learned a lot regarding the subject of personal finance, and has reaped the benefits of following those that laid the path before me, it’s only natural for me to want to “pay it forward”. Much like someone who has recently quit smoking, you’re eager to encourage your friends (or family) to do the same, so they can share the same benefits you receive from dropping the habit yourself. But, I think we all know how that can make a person look. Nobody likes that guy. \\n\\nGiving financial advice is akin to giving someone parental advice. We all know that soliciting your parenting advice to another parent who appears to be struggling with reigning in their child’s behavior without being asked for said advice, is going to go over like a fart in church. “Don’t tell me how to raise my child!!” Sound familiar? I don’t care if your friends or not. It doesn’t matter if you raised three perfect angels yourself, and are merely attempting to help. It’s not going to go over very well, and especially if the parent you are soliciting your advice to, is in distress at the very moment you offer this advice.   \\n \\n\\nPersonal finance is literally the exact same thing. And soliciting ideas without being asked will result in very similar outcomes. You see, like the parenting analogy, sometimes people are going down completely different paths than you. They are usually peppered with knowledge from their parents, their other peers, what they read on the internet, and none of which align with their actual reality. They may not even be on a path, but stumbling through the thicket straying farther and farther from the path they actually need to be on. Needless to say, if they aren’t on the right path, personal finance can be a touchy subject.\\n\\nThere are two different people who end up in the tree line just off the beaten path. Those who are certain they can navigate back to the path on their own without the help from anyone, and those who give up and admit they need help. One of these types of people will eventually approach you, the other will not. It’s important to discern the difference between these two types, no matter what your relationship is with them.   \\n \\n\\nI’m not saying the people determined to figure it out on their own are lost causes. I’m just saying, to stand on the path near them and be ready to help them out only if they ask for it. And if they make it back to the path on their own, a simple “nice job!” will suffice. No need to discuss their straying from the path any more than that.\\n\\nBut, the people you want to help, are the people who ask for your help. The person off the beaten path who yells out for you is the person you are more than likely going to help. Going back to the parenting analogy; let’s say you and your friend are out and a restaurant with both of you accompanied by your only child. Both children are four years old and obviously your kid is acting like the angel they should. But their kid is freaking the fuck out. Jumping up and down in the booth, throwing food and tantrums, running around the restaurant and sticking their booger laden fingers in other people’s meals. It’s clear that your friend is at wit’s end and seems to falling apart at the seams. Now is not the time to rub in their face that your child is seemingly perfect and their child is Rosemary’s baby. Do not give out suggestions or ideas at this moment. Simply asking them “how can I help” is about as far as you should go at this point. Help where you can, but avoid the parenting advice. Trust me, it’s not the time.\\n\\nHowever, if your friend is nearly in tears and looks up at you and say; “I just don’t understand. Our two boys are literally a month apart in age, and your kid’s behavior is impeccable. They sit still, they are quiet and respectful of others. They don’t eat like a piggy like that one kid from ‘The Christmas Story’. I just don’t understand what I’m doing wrong. Do you have any tips for me?” Now is your time to shine. But tread carefully, as there is still a fine line here. It’s okay to share tips and techniques you employed on your own child, but be mindful of other factors that may differ from your own. For instance, don’t tell them that since before your child could walk you have taken them to restaurants on a regular basis to get them used to acting appropriately in public when you know that the person you are helping isn’t in the financial position to eat out more than once every couple months. A tip like that is of no use to them. But perhaps saying “Well, every time we are out in public, and little Timmy starts acting up, I threaten him that if the behavior continues, we will immediately leave the restaurant, party, grocery store, or whatever. And then I follow through with my threat. The minute they act out of line again, we pack up and go. Food is thrown in doggy bags, we leave the party, the food is returned and we exit the grocery store. It’s important, if you say you are going to do something, follow through. Your kid will eventually take you seriously, and adjust his behavior accordingly.” Now this a tip that anyone can use regardless of a lot of different factors that may be in place. \\n\\nThis same principal needs to be applied to personal finance. Don’t just hand out your “easier said than done” advice to someone in turmoil, and especially when nobody asked you. But there will come times when someone approaches you and says “Damn dude, you and I work the same job, live in the same neighborhood, and have the same amount of kids, yet I can’t make ends meet, and you are on a family trip every other month and seem to have money for any emergency that creeps up. How are you doing it?” This would be the time to start asking questions. First and foremost, you should find out what factors are different between the two of you and be mindful of them. This person may have a $100,000 Student loan weighing them down when you never went to college. Or their divorce five years ago is still taking them to the cleaners. Doing exactly what you did with your personal finance may not be realistic. But offering the tools and techniques that pretty much everyone can use is a great way to start this dialogue.  Things like how you price match everything you buy, or delay instant gratification by prolonging impulse purchases, or even using coupons to save a few bucks a month. It may even be a perfect time to advise them how much you saved by quitting smoking last year. \\n\\nBut now enters a fickle beast. The one who comes to you for financial advice, you give it, and they don’t follow any of it. You know, the one who yells at you from inside the forest, asking you to yell back so they can follow your voice, only to walk deeper into the forest. Browsing social media a few years back, I was introduced to the word “Askhole”, defined as someone who asks for advice but never follows it. Now let me tell you, I’ve met my share of askholes. These are the people who constantly hound you about every aspect of your personal finance. You then spill your heart out to these people essentially taking on the role of their mentor. But after several months, you notice that their finances haven’t improved at all. And in some cases, they are worse. Delving deeper, you find out all the things you tell them to do, they just do the opposite. And if you bring up the fact that they didn’t do it the way you advised them, they somehow find a way to justify why they didn’t follow your advice (which is usually not a very good justification). This just doesn’t apply to personal finances either. This applies to pretty much every facet of life. We all know a person like this. But there will come a time when your patience will wear thin with the askholes in your life. So, how do you handle them?\\n\\nYou have to ask yourself a very easy question. Do you value your relationship with this person? Every person you help has a different value associated with them. A co-worker who only comes to you when he has a financial questions is valued differently than a friend you’ve known since high school. In either case, it may be time to remove financial discussions from taking place any more. You can only be so supportive before you start becoming critical. And when you start being critical, people (even the ones you value) will inevitably take offense. How you drop this subject matter will depend on the value you put on your relationship with them. \\n\\nA co-worker who only appears when he has a credit card question, is obviously the easiest to deal with. Simply telling them that they never listen to your advice, so you are going to stop giving it, is usually the simplest thing to do. Again, in their mind, they have somehow justified why they continue to go down the path (or wherever they are in the woods) they are currently going down. You obviously aren’t getting through to them. They may take offense to this, but does it really matter at this point? Sure, it’s important to keeping your working relationship amicable, but it’s a lot easier to forbid the subject rather than wait until someone takes it to the extreme and becomes either too critical or takes excessive offense to that criticism. We want to avoid resentment at all cost. \\n\\nBut how do you handle the same scenario with someone who you care a lot for? It’s important to be a lot more delicate about it, but with the same ultimate goal to rid future discussions of anything financial. Again, if you continue to harp on them about how they aren’t following any of your advice, you start to move into a world that results in utter resentment. Sometimes, there are people who just can’t get over certain hurdles in life. I once saw a poster that said; “The difference between stepping stones and stumbling blocks is how you use them”. Much like a junkie trying to cut heroin from their life, there are just some habits that aren’t easy to break for some people. Berating them for their failures isn’t going to help them out of that rut, it will only build resentment. But, obviously your advice isn’t helping them. You have to step back and move away from them (as it pertains to the subject matter in question). Continuing to flaunt how easy it was for you to do it, isn’t going to help them either. Usually by this time, several arguments have spawned regarding personal finance. And each one seems to be worse than the one before. Before this relationship’s fate is sealed, you have to have a heart to heart with that person. Explaining to them that every time you discuss personal finance, it usually ends up with someone (or both) being bitter about the other. What was once envy, is now jealousy. And jealousy is just envy with a splash of resentment. Jealousy is ugly and rarely results in anything remotely good. Taking discussions of personal finance off the table will be imperative to avoiding this relationship from going off the rails.  Simply telling them that you will no longer discuss finances with them from there on out is your best approach. And I mean every aspect of it. Don’t discuss anything regarding your finances with them, and remind them of the off-limit subject when they bring up their own. \\n\\nI have ultimately lost many friendships by continuing to have these types of discussions, with many of them resulting in not talking to each other for days because of them. If you don’t put at an end to financial talks, one of the arguments will result in never speaking to each other again. Since, I have made the conscious effort to interject when it appears financial discussions constantly go awry, I’ve been able to keep the relationships I find the most value in. \\n\\nIt’s not easy watching someone you care for continue to walk away from the path, but it’s important to keep your own mental health in check. If you constantly step into the woods to help them, you’ll eventually lose track of your own path and be stuck in the woods with them. It’s not the position you want to be in. Its times like this, you’re going to have to be a little selfish. Make sure you are safe before you are checking on the safety of others. Much like putting on your oxygen mask on a plane before helping those around you. You are no help to others if you are unconscious.\",\n",

       "     'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been writing a book for the last couple years regarding my journey to a million dollars (net worth).  The first part is primarily the story, and the second part is a detail of lessons I&amp;#39;ve learned along the way.  I&amp;#39;ve struggled with one particular chapter more than any others and thought I&amp;#39;d post it here to get some feedback.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Writing this book is mostly therapeutic and the likelihood of it ever being published is slim.  So, I&amp;#39;m not trying to sell or pitch the book.  I&amp;#39;m a terrible editor, so look past the spelling and grammatical errors. I just want your personal opinions regarding this chapter.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Without further ado:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finances and Friends Can Be Like Oil and Water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Talking about personal finance with your peers, especially your friends can be a delicate and fragile venture. It seems that friends should be able to talk about anything, right? I’ve had to learn the hard way that this isn’t always the case. Talking about finances can be extremely toxic if both parties do not share the same logic as each other. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If two people, chasing the same financial dreams, with the same factors in place, decide to discuss personal finance, it usually goes off without a hitch. After all, you’re both like-minded, and have the same ultimate goal of attaining financial peace. It’s easier to bounce ideas off of each other, and learn from each other’s inevitable mistakes during the process. You can become each other’s cheerleader and often keep each other in line when the urges, that pressure all of us, come pushing down on you. Much like two buddies that hit the gym together with the ultimate goal of achieving a healthier lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But if two people with completely different factors attempt to discuss personal finance, I’ve noticed it often results in some awkward moments. And in a few cases, has completely terminated friendships. This isn’t always the case, but can be the case depending on the mindset of the people involved. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As someone who feels they’ve learned a lot regarding the subject of personal finance, and has reaped the benefits of following those that laid the path before me, it’s only natural for me to want to “pay it forward”. Much like someone who has recently quit smoking, you’re eager to encourage your friends (or family) to do the same, so they can share the same benefits you receive from dropping the habit yourself. But, I think we all know how that can make a person look. Nobody likes that guy. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Giving financial advice is akin to giving someone parental advice. We all know that soliciting your parenting advice to another parent who appears to be struggling with reigning in their child’s behavior without being asked for said advice, is going to go over like a fart in church. “Don’t tell me how to raise my child!!” Sound familiar? I don’t care if your friends or not. It doesn’t matter if you raised three perfect angels yourself, and are merely attempting to help. It’s not going to go over very well, and especially if the parent you are soliciting your advice to, is in distress at the very moment you offer this advice.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Personal finance is literally the exact same thing. And soliciting ideas without being asked will result in very similar outcomes. You see, like the parenting analogy, sometimes people are going down completely different paths than you. They are usually peppered with knowledge from their parents, their other peers, what they read on the internet, and none of which align with their actual reality. They may not even be on a path, but stumbling through the thicket straying farther and farther from the path they actually need to be on. Needless to say, if they aren’t on the right path, personal finance can be a touchy subject.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There are two different people who end up in the tree line just off the beaten path. Those who are certain they can navigate back to the path on their own without the help from anyone, and those who give up and admit they need help. One of these types of people will eventually approach you, the other will not. It’s important to discern the difference between these two types, no matter what your relationship is with them.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying the people determined to figure it out on their own are lost causes. I’m just saying, to stand on the path near them and be ready to help them out only if they ask for it. And if they make it back to the path on their own, a simple “nice job!” will suffice. No need to discuss their straying from the path any more than that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But, the people you want to help, are the people who ask for your help. The person off the beaten path who yells out for you is the person you are more than likely going to help. Going back to the parenting analogy; let’s say you and your friend are out and a restaurant with both of you accompanied by your only child. Both children are four years old and obviously your kid is acting like the angel they should. But their kid is freaking the fuck out. Jumping up and down in the booth, throwing food and tantrums, running around the restaurant and sticking their booger laden fingers in other people’s meals. It’s clear that your friend is at wit’s end and seems to falling apart at the seams. Now is not the time to rub in their face that your child is seemingly perfect and their child is Rosemary’s baby. Do not give out suggestions or ideas at this moment. Simply asking them “how can I help” is about as far as you should go at this point. Help where you can, but avoid the parenting advice. Trust me, it’s not the time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, if your friend is nearly in tears and looks up at you and say; “I just don’t understand. Our two boys are literally a month apart in age, and your kid’s behavior is impeccable. They sit still, they are quiet and respectful of others. They don’t eat like a piggy like that one kid from ‘The Christmas Story’. I just don’t understand what I’m doing wrong. Do you have any tips for me?” Now is your time to shine. But tread carefully, as there is still a fine line here. It’s okay to share tips and techniques you employed on your own child, but be mindful of other factors that may differ from your own. For instance, don’t tell them that since before your child could walk you have taken them to restaurants on a regular basis to get them used to acting appropriately in public when you know that the person you are helping isn’t in the financial position to eat out more than once every couple months. A tip like that is of no use to them. But perhaps saying “Well, every time we are out in public, and little Timmy starts acting up, I threaten him that if the behavior continues, we will immediately leave the restaurant, party, grocery store, or whatever. And then I follow through with my threat. The minute they act out of line again, we pack up and go. Food is thrown in doggy bags, we leave the party, the food is returned and we exit the grocery store. It’s important, if you say you are going to do something, follow through. Your kid will eventually take you seriously, and adjust his behavior accordingly.” Now this a tip that anyone can use regardless of a lot of different factors that may be in place. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This same principal needs to be applied to personal finance. Don’t just hand out your “easier said than done” advice to someone in turmoil, and especially when nobody asked you. But there will come times when someone approaches you and says “Damn dude, you and I work the same job, live in the same neighborhood, and have the same amount of kids, yet I can’t make ends meet, and you are on a family trip every other month and seem to have money for any emergency that creeps up. How are you doing it?” This would be the time to start asking questions. First and foremost, you should find out what factors are different between the two of you and be mindful of them. This person may have a $100,000 Student loan weighing them down when you never went to college. Or their divorce five years ago is still taking them to the cleaners. Doing exactly what you did with your personal finance may not be realistic. But offering the tools and techniques that pretty much everyone can use is a great way to start this dialogue.  Things like how you price match everything you buy, or delay instant gratification by prolonging impulse purchases, or even using coupons to save a few bucks a month.

I am looking for some help or leads to understanding what I need to invest in inside my Roth. Right now I&amp;#39;ve got VTI but I need some help understanding what other kind of Mutual funds or ETFs I should buy into to and how to understand what they are.
